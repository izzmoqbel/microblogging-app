## Project Overview

In this project, we will build a personal microblogging website that allows a single admin user to manage and publish blog posts. The application will enable the admin to create, read, update, and delete blog entries, providing a platform for sharing content. Users visiting the site can view a list of blogs on the home page and access detailed views of individual blog posts. The application will also include search functionality, allowing users to find specific blogs by title or content.

The project will be built using PHP for the backend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend will handle data management, including user authentication and blog operations, while the frontend will focus on rendering the user interface and interacting with the backend APIs.
